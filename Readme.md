# Smart Home

You can navigate the menu with the numbers 0 to 9.
0 is always the back button.
In the devices-menu you can exit the program with pressing 0.
In the commands-menu you can refresh the page with 9.
You'll be asked if you really want to exit, please confirm this with the buttons from 1 to 9,
use 0 for reentering the devices-menu.

The command interrupt is the equivalent for stop/turn off commands in the assignment,
only in WashingMachine we have a turn off command, since it has to behave differently,
because the selected program has to finish first.

Oven and Microwave oven: temperatures are possible from 1 to 250.

Turn off for the Washing machine "soft" resets the device.
